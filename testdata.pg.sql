These problems become more common in old age, and as the average life expectancy increases, they will \r\nbecome a growing problem in the provision of appropriate health care. New technologies and scientific methods are being developed to study how the brain ages, and how sensory and cognitive skills change with age. The projects \r\nare particularly concerned with listening, comprehending and speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### In search of biomarkers for cognitive ageing in the human brain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Professor Zoe Kourtzi, Birmingham University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £29,961  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Cognitive Ageing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/kourtzi(PL).pdf)\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop new tools for cognitive ageing research by combining methods from mathematics, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience. In particular, we will combine advanced mathematical approaches \r\n(i.e. machine learning) for the analysis of biological data (behavioural performance, functional brain activations) with multimodal brain imaging techniques (structural MR, functional MRI, EEG) and behavioural \r\nmethods. This integration of advanced measurement and analysis methods will allow us to develop new sensitive tools for studying the variability of cognitive ageing across individuals from rapid decline to \r\nsustained high levels of performance. Our methods and findings will provide new insights in understanding life-long learning and cortical plasticity and will be potentially useful for early diagnosis and intervention \r\nin normal and pathological ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Investigating the neural underpinnings of word-finding problems across the lifespan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Professor Lorraine Tyler, Cambridge University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £40,022  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Where’s that Name?](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Tyler(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Where’s that Word? Word finding problems in older age](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_tyler.pdf)\r\n\r\nAging involves a gradual loss of neural tissue (atrophy), and atrophy in a particular brain region can affect abilities that depend on that region. Although some abilities decline on average in old age, some older adults \r\nmaintain good performance. The key to this “successful” ageing may be the brain''s ability to flexibly find alternative ways to perform a task that overcome the effects of atrophy – a process called “neural compensation”. \r\nThis study examines neural compensation in speaking and listening to language. We choose to examine language because while some aspects of language decline with age (such as remembering people''s names), not all older \r\nadults have problems, with some performing as well as younger adults. This study will use a combination of brain imaging techniques for measuring brain atrophy and activity to reveal whether older adults with preserved \r\nlanguage abilities also show evidence of neural compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What makes synthetic speech difficult to understand for older people?

Thus the decline in our strength and dexterity as we age has \r\nserious consequences. The lives of many older people are made a misery by the challenges of everyday packaging, restricting their choice as consumers and in some cases compromising their nutrition \r\nand general health. Despite much work on torque and grip strength of older people, only recently has a realistic test jam jar been developed – a glass container with a metal closure and with \r\nrobust measurement equipment inside. Further development work will be undertaken to make the device more portable and capable of gathering the extensive data required by food manufacturers if they \r\nare to be persuaded to provide packaging which is more friendly towards people of all abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer relevant biomechanical data: Packages opening in an older adult population\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Avril Thomson, Strathclyde University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £56,587  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Package Opening](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Thomson%20general%20(pl)  .pdf)\r\n[Scientific Poster: Using Biomechanics](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Thomson%20scientific%20(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Designing for Inclusion](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_thomson.pdf)  \r\n\r\nBiomechanical research is producing valuable data relating to the strength and mobility of the older generation and how they interact with products such as consumer packaging. However, the existence of \r\nthis data is frequently not apparent in their design. There are thought to be a number of reasons for this including:- designers are not aware that the data exists, the data is presented in a format that \r\ndesigners find difficult to understand and use, and data produced from biomechanical testing does not match the requirements of product designers. The ultimate aim of this research is to facilitate both \r\nproduct designers and bioengineers by ensuring that biomechanical tests match the requirements of product designers and that the resulting data is presented in a meaningful and useable format.\r\n\r\nMany older people use computers to access the internet.

For older adults, however, computers can be difficult to use because of the need to control a cursor accurately for selecting \r\ntargets on the screen. This project will investigate techniques for improving target selection with a computer mouse. In particular, we are interested in learning if dynamic targets, for example icons that expand \r\nor move toward the cursor, can make target selection easier for older computer users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mathematical Modelling of Age Related Differences in Web Browsing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Panayiotis Zaphiris, City University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £26,600  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Web Browsing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Zaphiris%20(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Age-related Differences in Browsing the Web](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_zaphiris.pdf)  \r\n\r\nHow information is categorised, labelled and presented and how navigation is facilitated determines not only whether users will and can find what they need, but also affects user satisfaction and it does influence \r\nreturn visits.

There is little knowledge of what this workforce sector requires, how organisations \r\nview these issues or what help they need to accommodate older workers. This study will explore the match between older workers'' capacities, abilities and expectations, and organisational \r\nrequirements and strategies in the office and manual sectors. It will highlight the user perspective of being an older worker and the management perspective of employing an older workforce \r\nthrough discussion with managers, currently employed workers, those who retired at the traditional age, and those who retired early. This ergonomics study will explore strengths and weaknesses \r\nof workplace design by looking at individual (e.g. physical aspects of workplace, job scheduling, training) and organisational factors (e.g. team working, support, policies) and will highlight \r\nadjustments/ procedures/ policies/ support networks that organisations should adopt to ensure a healthy working environment for all, and to extend productive working lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ageing in construction workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Professor Alistair Gibb, Loughborough University  \r\n* 6 months  \r\n* £33,073  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Ageing and Physical Workloads](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Gibb%20(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Understanding the Older Worker in Construction](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_gibb.pdf)  \r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to better understand the abilities and needs of older workers, through surveying them, to see how they fit within the changing workplaces of the construction \r\nindustry. It should also establish the parameters of equipment design to see how new equipment, being introduced to assist construction workers generally, addresses the special needs of older workers. \r\nThe need for this work has resulted from the construction industry''s skills shortage – the early retirement of workers from the physically demanding workloads present in the construction industry \r\nbeing compounded by school leavers and graduates seeing the industry as ''dirty and dangerous'' and seeking more appealing forms of employment.', '', '', '', '2010-01-19 20:59:27'),

In the UK, the care for \r\nolder patients with hip fracture has been identified as an area with the highest potential for improving the quality and value of clinical care through changes in the \r\norganisation of care delivery. One of the challenges is the ability to identify the organisational changes that will lead to the desired improvements. Computer simulation \r\nis a common scientific approach to evaluating the likely response of a health system to a range of suggested changes. Under this approach, the progress of patients through \r\nthe care delivery processes is imitated by a computer model.

It is assisting those whose homes have to be altered to make key decisions, so that\r\nthe changes are beneficial and do not destroy the essential nature and meaning of their homes. Making homes safer and more secure is being\r\ninvestigated through developing the potential contribution of new and innovatory electronic technologies.\r\n\r\n### Design and the Home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Professor Paul Chamberlain, Sheffield Hallam University\r\n* 12 months\r\n* £23,178\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: ''Living Rooms''](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Chamberlain%20%28PL%29.pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: When Designers Meet Older People](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_chamberlain.pdf)  \r\n\r\nOur investigation aims to inform the design and construction of a physical Living room environment that can be utilised\r\nas a test lab in evaluating theories and conceptual designs in response to the ageing population and independent living.

Often to achieve this their homes have to be altered, \r\nbathrooms enlarged, and ramps, rails and other equipment, such as stairlifts, installed. The experience of alteration work can be very \r\ntraumatic and can lead to irredeemable changes to the “home”. In anticipation of much distress many older people decline the opportunity \r\nto improve their living conditions. This study will consider the use of modern information and visualisation technologies for improving \r\nthe design and implementation of adaptations.

Currently the only way to treat cataract is by surgical intervention. A cataract operation involves removal of parts of the lens, \r\nnamely a small opening at the front, and the tissue bulk known as lens fibres. By carrying out this procedure the cloudy region is removed and a clear passage of light created. The remaining lens tissue is termed a capsular \r\nbag. Lens cells survive the rigours of surgery, remain in the capsular bag and grow on to all available surfaces and through matrix wrinkling that gives rise to light scatter and a diminished visual quality. This secondary \r\nproblem is known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Injury to the lens, for example cataract surgery drives the rate of proliferation and growth in an age-dependent manner, such that growth rates, both in the clinic \r\nand the laboratory for human capsular bags are greater in the young than the old. Therefore, we will investigate using state of the art equipment, the relationship between age and the expression and activation of signalling \r\nmolecules, which are proteins likely to regulate PCO development. This data will have the added bonus of providing fundamental information on the ageing process and also relate directly to PCO, which through development of \r\ntherapies could improve the quality of life of cataract patients, who predominantly are aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Age, eye movement and motion perception\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Tom Freeman, Cardiff University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £37,229  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Active Vision](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Freeman(PL).pdf)  \r\n\r\nVisual images move principally because we move do. Yet little is known about the relationship between motion perception and activity, especially in older observers who often display difficulty with tasks such as driving. \r\nTo investigate potential causes we develop techniques that combine traditional motion psychophysics with specific types of self-movement. We concentrate on eye movement, specifically smooth pursuit to steadily moving targets,\r\npartly because this activity is ubiquitous - we continually pursuit eye movements to maintain gaze on objects of interest. While this allows helps with the visual analysis of fine detail, it also creates some interesting problems \r\nfor the visual system to solve. In particular, pursuit introduces whole-field changes to the visual image. To help disentangle image motion from world motion, non-visual (extra-retinal) signals for the motor system that carry \r\ninformation about eye velocity synapse with primary motion-processing centres in the cortex. We aim to understand the interaction between pursuit, extra-retinal signals and motion sensitivity, relating each to standard clinical \r\nindices of sensory ageing and visual function. Hopefully the work will raise our understanding of fundamental limits to motion perception in a more everyday context. As such it will provide a much needed balance to a field that\r\noveremphasises age-related changes to visual perception during static, passive observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The contribution of visuomotor decline to falls in older adults during adaptive locomotion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Mark Hollands, Birmingham University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £51,472  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Falling During Walking](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Hollands(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Mind where you Walk: Older People''s Vision and Stepping](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_hollands.pdf)  \r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, around 30% of adults over the age of 65 living in the community fall each year. Falls are a major cause of disability and the leading cause of mortality due to injury among older people aged over 75. Those older \r\npeople who survive a fall often suffer ongoing problems such as injury and infection, loss of confidence, loss of mobility leading to social isolation and depression, increased dependency and permanent disability. Most falls in all age \r\ngroups occur during walking on a level surface and therefore there is a clear need to understand the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in walking performance before this major health issue can be fully addressed. Previous \r\nresearch suggests that one contributing factor to age-related falls during walking is likely to be decline in the ability of older adults'' brains to process visual information describing environmental features (e.g. obstacles and safe \r\nplaces to step) and use this information to generate appropriate stepping movements. The study will be the first to examine how the brain''s ability to use vision in this way is affected by ageing and factors associated with falls risk. \r\nThis information will be invaluable in contributing to our understanding of why people are more prone to falling with increasing age and help in the development of both diagnostic techniques to identify older adults at risk of falling \r\nand treatment and intervention programmes that promote safe walking.\r\n', '', '', '', '2010-01-19 20:59:27'),

Current advice is that older people should keep active as exercise and a healthy diet help to maintain muscle, bone and tissue. SPARC projects cover a range of issues which \r\nlink movement, activity, strength, diet and heart function, with the aim of improving understanding of what constitutes a healthy life style in later years. This work is particularly important for developing more comprehensive advice, especially \r\nfor those people who cannot follow conventional exercise regimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ageing, exercise and gender: complex interactions and outcomes for all muscles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Matthew Lancaster, Leeds University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £25,500  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Giving an Old Heart Hope](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/3_27_06_award_holders/pdf/general_posters/Lancaster_General.pdf)  \r\n[Scientific Poster: Cardiac Ageing &amp; Exercise](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/3_27_06_award_holders/pdf/scientific_posters/Lancaster-Science.pdf)  \r\n\r\nhroughout the lifespan exercise is encouraged to promote cardiac, respiratory and musculo-skeletal health but the precise interactions of ageing, gender and different exercise protocols remain poorly understood. The development of a \r\nnew model of the effects of ageing on muscular function will enable future study of critical issues relating to, for example, aerobic capacity, healthy circulation, strength in skeletal muscle, cardiac capacity and resistance to \r\nirregular heart rate and heart attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optimisation of skeletal muscle responses and quality of life to exercise in people over 60 years old: healthy diet vs dietary supplementation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Gladys Onambele-Pearson, Manchester Metropolitan University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £28,245  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Lifestyle](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Peasron(general)(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Scientific Poster](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Pearson%20(scientific)(pl).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Healthy Diet v Dietary Supplementation: improving physical fitness and quality of life in older people](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_pearson.pdf)\r\n\r\nOlder people have the greatest barriers (mostly in terms of ability/opportunity) to participating in exercise, and thus have the highest incidence of decreased ease in carrying out tasks of daily living. In an ageing society, \r\nthe negative effects of age on skeletal muscle performance would be reduced if compliance to exercise regimens could be encouraged through simple advice on timing, duration, frequency, intensity, as well as appropriate \r\nnutritional interventions. Research into the impact of optimal nutrition/diet supplementation in young and/or athletic populations is extensive. Such data are scarce when considering healthy, older populations. We therefore \r\npropose to investigate the impact of healthy eating habits with or without supplementation, on exercise responsiveness. This protocol seeks to maximise training benefits on the neural muscular and tendinous complexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Temperature and velocity interactions in neuromuscular function during locomotion in older people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Richard Ferguson, Strathclyde University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £51,322  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Efficiency of Movement](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Ferguson(PL).pdf)  \r\n\r\nThe decline in mobility of the aging population, caused by a loss of muscle function, is an important issue in the quality of life. One way of helping to develop rehabilitative interventions to improve mobility in the older \r\npopulation is to enhance our understanding of factors that influence locomotory performance. One such factor that is not well understood is efficiency of movement, i.e., the energy required to produce a certain movement. \r\nThis research will lead to an understanding of how factors relevant to the elderly population, such as speed of movement and temperature, can influence efficiency. The research will also elucidate the neuromuscular mechanisms \r\nthat might explain these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The molecular basis of the beneficial effects of calorie restriction on ageing: DNA methylation influenced by Sirt1-mediated histone deacetylation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Dianne Ford, Newcastle University  \r\n* 8 months  \r\n* £43,888  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Calorie Restriction](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Ford%20lay%20(PL).pdf)  \r\n[Scientific Poster](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Ford%20scientific%20(PL).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: The Beneficial Effects of Calorie Restriction on Ageing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_ford.pdf)  \r\n\r\nSubstantial evidence indicates that restricting energy intake delays aspects of the ageing process but the mechanisms responsible for this beneficial effect remain unclear. The protein Sirt1, which increases in tissues and cells \r\nwhen energy intake is restricted, is emerging as a strong candidate for being a principal mediator of these effects and much research is focused on studying its mechanisms of action in this context. One known action of Sirt1 is \r\nto remove chemical groups from proteins called histones, which form a core around which the DNA in the cell''s nucleus is wrapped. This process is referred to as histone deacetylation. Deacetylation of histones is linked with a \r\nchemical modification to the DNA molecule itself – DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation occur with ageing. In this project we will investigate if expressing Sirt1 in cells alters histone deacetylation and/or DNA methylation \r\nto reveal a possible mechanism through which increasing Sirt1 expression through energy restriction can affect the process of ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lipoprotein Oxidation in Ageing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Sarah Aldred, Birmingham University  \r\n* 12 months  \r\n* £29,148  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Towards Active Ageing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Aldred_general(PL).pdf)  \r\n[Scientific Poster](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Aldred_science(PL).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Taking a Walk? physical activity and the health of older people](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_aldred.pdf)  \r\n\r\nOxidative damage to lipoproteins, in particular low density lipoprotein (LDL), is known to play a role in a number of diseases associated with ageing such as cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and dementia. \r\nExercise can alter the balance of oxidative and anti-oxidative species within the human body. Although it was first assumed that due to an increased oxygen metabolism, exercise would induce an increased release of reactive oxygen \r\nand nitrogen species causing damage to proteins, DNA and lipids, more recent research has indicated that exercise induced radical species are key to adaptive processes. The aim of the proposed study is to assess parameters of \r\nlipoprotein protein and lipid oxidation, and lipoprotein nitration in aged individuals who undertake a programme of moderate physical activity for a period of 8 weeks, in order to identify changes due to physical activity which \r\nmay impact upon diseases associated with ageing.', '', '', '', '2010-01-19 20:59:27'),

Werner’s Syndrome is a very dramatic premature \r\nageing syndrome that is often used as a model system for human ageing. The in vitro treatment of certain types of Werner’s Syndrome tissue cells with a particular drug has shown that accelerated ageing can be prevented. However \r\nthe underlying mechanisms are unclear. The study will determine the most plausible explanation and delineate a path to the next step towards developing possible treatments for those who suffer from the syndrome. It will also offer \r\ninsights into the development of inhibitors of those enzymes which trigger accelerated ageing in normal individuals as a result of stress, infection or chronic wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chemical analysis of ageing tissue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Elizabeth Ostler, Brighton University   \r\n* 18 months  \r\n* £58,820  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[General Poster: Ageing Flies](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/3_27_06_award_holders/pdf/general_posters/Ostler_General.pdf)  \r\n[Scientific Poster](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/3_27_06_award_holders/pdf/scientific_posters/Ostler_Scientific.pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Can the Fruit Fly Help us to Understand how we Age](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_ostler.pdf)  \r\n\r\nAdvanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) are the result of ubiquitous unwanted reactions between reducing sugars and amino acids that form adducts on proteins. These adducts accumulate with age, at an increased rate in diabetic patients, \r\nwith particular implications for long lived structures such as the eye lens because they can interfere with the biological functions of proteins. Levels of AGEs correlate with an increased rate of morbidity, probably by causing tissue \r\ndysfunction.

However, a current limitation of these genetic studies is that statistical associations between healthy ageing and particular\r\ninherited gene variants cannot easily be backed up by direct evidence of biochemical changes in ageing pathways. One key theory of ageing holds that ageing-related oxidative damage to cellular components is responsible for declining human function.\r\nWe propose to establish high-throughput assays of oxidative damage biomarkers (suitable for the analysis of thousands of human blood samples) so that we can begin to assess the effects of candidate, ageing-related, gene variants on oxidative damage.\r\nWe believe this will provide the necessary tools for major advances in understanding the role of oxidative stress in human ageing.\r\n\r\nThe ageing process is a something which humans share with the vast majority of other species on the planet. Ageing evolved at least a billion years ago and has been part of the genetic inheritance of species ever since. Studying the basic mechanisms \r\nof ageing in proteins, cells, tissues and animals, allows us to understand how they operate.

It is clear that ageing is associated with significant changes in relatively few proteins but this is an area \r\nwhich has been hardly examined. So, this study will provide new information concerning the role of changes in protein expression in neuronal ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gene expression profiling to understand stem cell ageing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dr Ilaria Bellantuono, Sheffield University  \r\n* 10 months  \r\n* £28,288  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Poster: Stem Cell Ageing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/workshops/11_01_07_award_holders_2/pdf/Bella(PL).pdf)  \r\n[Executive Summary: Gene Expression Profiling to Understand Stem Cell Ageing](http://www.sparc.ac.uk/media/downloads/executivesummaries/exec_summary_bellantuono.pdf)  \r\n\r\nStem cells (SC) are present in all organs and are responsible for the maintenance of their function.

Down''s syndrome (DS) shows signs \r\nof premature ageing with features found commonly in older people such as Alzheimer disease.

However, functional immunity declines with age, leading to various clinical manifestations. Cells known as Natural Killer (NK) cells play \r\na central role in the immune system and we believe that their function declines with age. To test this hypothesis we will compare what NK cells look like from young and elderly individuals. We will also compare their functional activity.

Seeking out solutions, improving quality \r\nof life and well-being, requires multidisciplinary research teams, engagement with the many \r\norganisations and agencies which work with older and disabled people, and recognising the \r\npreferences, knowledge and expertise of older and disabled people and their carers.\r\n\r\nOver the last seven years, EQUAL and SPARC have introduced many new scientists to the exciting challenges of ageing research, and have secured their long-term commitment to the area. They have \r\nhelped to build a superb rapport across many different communities of stakeholders and interest \r\ngroups, by showing that ageing and disability research can and does make a difference to the lives \r\nof people. This has resulted in an incredible level of support, interest and encouragement in this \r\nnext stage of getting research into practice. EPSRC’s EQUAL initiative showed that by keeping \r\nresearchers close to research users and beneficiaries as well as ensuring that that they were \r\nnetworked to policy makers, major improvements, locally and nationally, could be achieved very \r\nquickly. EQUAL has had a significant influence on official regulations, standards, good practice \r\nand, importantly, expectations about the quality of the built environment, about the design of \r\nproducts and systems, and about the support which information technologies can provide to older \r\nand disabled people, in good and in poor health.', '2010-11-04 12:00', 1, 1),

SPARC is stimulating ageing research\r\nin three ways. Firstly, it has showcased the latest research findings from design, engineering and biology to all\r\nstakeholders in older people’s issues and it has listened to the issues raised by practitioners and by older people\r\nabout the realities of ageing. Secondly, it has lobbied policy makers about the needs of older people and how these\r\nneeds can be met and quality of life enhanced through the pursuit and application of research. Thirdly, it has provided\r\npump-priming funds to newcomers to ageing research. SPARC awards were highly sought after as they have provided an\r\naccelerated path into ageing research. SPARC was supported by a single joint grant from BBSRC and EPSRC and was managed \r\nby members of the research community.\r\nMay want to include link to SPARC website, url: http://www.sparc.ac.uk/ \r\n\r\n## EPSRC\r\n\r\nThe Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\r\n\r\nEPSRC is the main UK government agency for funding research and training in engineering and the physical sciences, investing more\r\nthan £800 million a year in a broad range of subjects – from mathematics to materials science, and from information\r\ntechnology to structural engineering.\r\n\r\nEPSRC contributed a £1,763,400 grant to the SPARC project.\r\n(Taken from the EPSRC website)\r\nMay want to include link to EPSRC website, url: http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ \r\n\r\n## BBSRC\r\n\r\nThe Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.\r\n\r\nThe BBSRC''s mission is to promote and support, by any means, high-quality basic, strategic and applied research and related \r\npostgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems.\r\n\r\nTo advance knowledge and technology (including the promotion and support of the exploitation of research outcomes), and \r\nprovide trained scientists and engineers, which meet the needs of users and beneficiaries (including the agriculture, \r\nbioprocessing, chemical, food, healthcare, pharmaceutical and other biotechnological related industries), thereby contributing \r\nto the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom and the quality of life.\r\n(Taken from the [BBSRC website](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk))\r\n', '2010-11-04 12:00', 2, 1),
